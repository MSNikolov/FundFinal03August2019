It was my first time in the SoftUni building so I got just a little too nervous. First  problem was a simple string manipulator and even though I solved tons of them I instantly forgot how it is done :D However I succeded at my fifth try. 
Second one was a regex task - again, due to butterflies I did not read the desctription very accurantely and had to go back a few times.
Third task - I decided to go with a dictionary<string, int[]>. Had two complile time errors in the judge system - because I forgot some if-checks :D
Overall - a great experience, I had 300/300 points and got 6th in the entire contest (out of 396 I think). Not great, not terrible ;)
